Resume
=========

What kind of a nerd uses JSON/JS/HTML/React/Webpack to generate a resume?

This guy.

I dunno - I hated having to write a resume, and I didn't want to be fiddiling with layouts as I was also having to come up with what to write, so I decided to start by writing all the info I wanted to show in JSON, and bind it to a UI later. I think it worked pretty well for me.
